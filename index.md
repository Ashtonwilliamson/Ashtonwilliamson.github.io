<h1>Interest in IT
</h1>
<p>I have always had an interest in technology. From a young age I have always been on technology and loved it and as I got older, I wanted to know more about it and make a career out of it. I have spent most of my life gaming and online and I don’t regret it at all, everything you can do in today’s day and age online is just insane.
I think my dad is defiantly the one who sparked my interest in IT, he works in IT and has been for a very long time. Dad always had technology in the house and taught me little cool tricks with them. I think just being around that made me curious and that lead on to me taking this course and wanting to pursue a career in IT.
I decided to come to RMIT because of the course itself when looking at it and reading through what we are going to be taught it caught my interest. I also know people who have through RMIT themselves and spoke very highly of it.
I am expecting to learn the basics of information technology and a wide range of knowledge and skills about the industry. I would really love to learn more about cyber security because that is something I believe I want to pursue as my career. I want to understand and cover a broad range of areas in IT from security, programming, systems and networks, data analysis, app/game development and machine learning.</p>
</p>
<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
<p>My ideal job would be a cyber security job. This penetration tester seems exactly like what I want to do.
Th job includes identifying and solving security problems in person and remotely. Providing security assurance services. To also prepare high quality reports detailing security issues, Reverse engineer malware or spam and also design and conduct simulated social engineering attacks.
 I would like to have this job because I find it interesting, and I want to help company’s stay safe from online threats.
For this position they want you to have 2+ years of penetration testing experience. It is highly regarded if you have Industry recognised certifications in penetration testing. For this job you must know coding languages such as Python, BASH, java, ruby, perl. You must be able to do technical writing and documentation.
Although it is helpful to have a degree in computer science, IT or cyber security not all penetration testing jobs require a degree. Typically your level of experience and ability to complete tasks matter more that your degree.
I currently have very little experience and no qualifications in this industry.
I am taking steps towards this job title by doing this Bachelor of Information Technology course and after this course I am thinking of doing a post graduate course specialising in cyber security to try to best prepare myself for this job and put myself in the best possible position to obtain this job.
</p>
<h1>Personality testing </h1>
<p>Myers-Briggs test = Virtuoso. ISTP-T
Learning test = Auditory: 30%, Visual: 30% Tactile: 40%. I am a Tactile learner.
Big 5 personality test. My low characteristics are openness to experience, extraversion, and neuroticism. I had high characteristics of conscientiousness and medium characteristics of Agreeableness.
I agree completely with the learning test I know that I am a hand on learner and that is the most effective way for me to remember and take in the information. The Myers-Briggs test is somewhat correct I wouldn’t say I’m a introverted person but when I have a task or goal I have to complete I do like to do it by myself.
I think I will be okay in my group/team my characteristics show I have medium agreeableness which means I will be able to come to a agreeance with my peers.
Should probably take it into account to make a team with people how have different characteristics to you so that you have a diverse range of personalities and skills throughout the team.

<h1>My IT project </h1>
<p>My IT project ideal is a basketball player app. The app is called Player Critique. The apps’ main purpose is to point out weak spots in your game to help you adjust and make improvements. This app works by entering your individual stats after every game and uploading game film into the app and it watches over and analysis your performance after every game. This app will point out Key holes in your game and emphasise strong points aswel, it will not only tell you the areas you need to improve on, but it will give you praise for the areas it thinks you are excelling at.
My motivation for creating this app is because basketball currently sits at 2nd most played sport in Australia. There is currently 1.1 million players Australia wide. This Factor is why I think the app will be successful because there will be a reasonably big market for this product. While the sport is rapidly increasing and skill levels are getting higher every player is pushing themselves and thriving to be the best they can, so I believe that if this app is developed many players would use it in hope of bettering their skills and understanding weak points in their game.
This app will be a great tool for players to better skills. The app will have features such as, Shooting style and technique- this feature will tell you if your shooting form Is good or bad, it will work by firstly setting putting your phone Infront of you about to shoot a basketball and record it, then upload that little clip to the app and it will analysis it and compare it to the “perfect shooting technique” and give you tips and pointers as to where to fix it. It may be something as simple and widen your base, bring elbow in slightly or higher ark in your shot.
Another one of this app’s features will be defensive analysis. Again, this process will start with uploading game film to the app, then it will analyse your defensive skills on the court. It will count how many times you are scored on and how many times you stop your opponent from scoring, giving you a defensive efficiency percentage. It will give you tips as to body positioning on defence, it will tell you if you are getting into the right defensive positions when the ball is not in the player you are defending’s hands.
This app will record your shooting percentages in game and record the spots you shoot from as-well, which will result in giving you your hot zones which will be determined on places on the floor you shoot above 50% from, and cold zones which will be places you shoot under 50% from.
All stats must be entered into this app after every game for the full detailed report on your performance. It will record your assists, rebounds, points, turnovers, fouls, +/-, shooting percentages and minutes played. At the end of the season, you can combine all statistics you have recorded through this app and it will give you’re an end of season report. It will work out your average points per game, assists per game and rebounds per game.
This app will have special features which will be suggested training drills. This will be determined by gameday stats. If you are regularly having a poor shooting percentage from the 3pt line the app will suggest some 3pt shooting drills for the week. If you were having regular games with multiple turn overs, it will suggest some passing/ ball handling drills. The app will continue to give these training drills until an improvement has been made to your game day stats.
This app’s main goal is to bring the best out of athletes, to point out weaknesses that need attention and to be worked on, but also highlight your strengths to show you what you have been doing good on the court. If you’re unsure of your offensive and defensive ability’s and where your strengths lie that’s exactly what is app if for to make it clear as day as to what you are good and what needs improvements. At the end of the day this app is designed to make basketball easier and make it easier for players to have access to a service that can help them and answer their questions about their game at any time anywhere if they have a device on them.
Within the app will have motion sensing software for the app to be able to critique the players shooting technique and defensive positions. It will be mark less Motion Capture will be used for pattern recognition. The silhouette of the player will be captured but a camera or multiple cameras and then uploaded to the app to analyse player movement and performance.  It will be programmed with python and that will calculate the statistics and averages.
We will need someone who is a expert in body movement to be able to get information from to input it into the program of the app. We will need expert programmers and app developers. We will need a example person to film for the perfect shooting technique, most likely a professional basketball player to model shooting form from. Programmers will be needed to program the app to calculate statistics and figure out averages. We will need basketball coach to give drills for certain areas of basketball for the app to suggest to players who need to work on certain areas.
Overall if this project is successful it could potentially expand to include more sports to expand the market for more consumers of this service. If it took off and became big, sports like soccer, AFL, hockey, boxing, baseball, cricket, etc could be added so that we would be helping more athletes than just basketball players. This app could potentially become the biggest player development app and become globally known and respected. This Development will do one thing and that is improve athletes skill levels across the world. The only possible drawbacks to this project I believe is actual coaches disagreeing and wanting players to only listen to them.
